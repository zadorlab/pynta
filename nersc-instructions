#### this is a general instruction to install and launch pynta on nersc machines ###

# - Working directory: 
# We have a project directory where you can install pynta, save scripts that you want to use for pynta. You can also store them on $HOME directory. However, the storage to $HOME is very limited. 
# 
# project directory is: /global/cfs/cdirs/<project number>
#
# Please ask your PI what your project number is.
# If the project directory is not set up, please ask your PI to create the directory.
# 
# - Production run:
# Due to the limited quota on $HOME, please execute production runs on working directory, or scratch directory.
# 
# 1. Before running pynta test, please request mongoDB account from NERSC. You need to request the MongoDB account via Iris, or by filling out the form here. https://docs.nersc.gov/services/databases/
# 
# 2. Set up Fireworks: 
# Instructions of connecting MongoDB and Fireworks as well as sample examples to run Fireworks is listed in NERSC document. https://docs.nersc.gov/jobs/workflow/fireworks/ It is a useful link to help you setup Fireworks to your (any) working environment. 
# 
# 3. Pynta-test
# When pynta and Fireworks are connected, you can run testruns. Details on test runs are written in pynta documents which you can find in Docs/. 
# For NERSC machines, there are a few things to change in order to run the test.
# 
#    (1) In pynta/testMain.py, 
#     def test_workflow(self):
#      lpad = LaunchPad.from_file("/where/your/launchpad/file/is/at/my_launchpad.yaml")
#      !!change the lpad path to the path where your "my_launchpad.yaml" is saved.
# 
#    (2) In testMain.py,
#    def test_workflow(self):
#    ...
#        pyn = Pynta(path=self.path,
#            launchpad_path="/where/your/launchpad/file/is/at/my_launchpad.yaml",
#     !!change the lpad path to the path where your "my_launchpad.yaml" is saved.  
#
# Once above changes are made, run the test.
